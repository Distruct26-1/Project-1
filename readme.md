## About

As a part of CS2430, we're tasked to implement several sorting algorithms, along with the tools to test them.

**Project Members**: Agnes Braz Franco, Christian Taylor, Dallin Yauney, Kathleen Monahan.

## Build instructions

The project has been tested to work on versions as early as Java 21, but earlier versions may be supported.

To run the test suite, you'll need to have JUnit5 in your build path. However, the main Tester can be run without this.

To run the benchmarks for lengths 4, 6, and 8 consecutively, run `java src/project1/Tester.java` (or `java src\project1\Tester.java` for Windows).

To specify an array length (or series of array lengths), pass them as command line inputs: `java src/project1/Tester.java 7` or `java src/project1/Tester.java 6 7 8`.
