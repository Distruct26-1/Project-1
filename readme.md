## About

As a part of CS2430, we're tasked to implement several sorting algorithms, along with the tools to test them.

**Project Members**: Agnes Braz Franco, Christian Taylor, Dallin Yauney, Kathleen Monahan.

## Build instructions

The project has been tested to work on Java 25, but earlier versions may be supported.

Run `java Tester.java` to run the automated benchmarking.
